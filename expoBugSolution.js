The solution often involves carefully reviewing the project's configuration and dependencies, along with clearing the Expo CLI cache.  Hereâ€™s how to address this:

1. **Clean the Cache:** Execute `expo prebuild --clean` to remove any potentially corrupted cached build artifacts.
2. **Check `package.json`:**  Verify all dependencies are compatible with the Expo SDK version. Use tools like `npm-check-updates` to find outdated packages.
3. **Review `expo.json`:** Double-check the contents of `expo.json` to ensure that the project's configurations are correct and all necessary settings are provided.  Common issues include incorrect asset paths or missing configurations.
4. **Install Dependencies Again:** After cleaning the cache, reinstall dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.  This can help address any corrupted package files.
5. **Reinstall Expo CLI:** If the problem persists, consider reinstalling the Expo CLI globally using `npm install -g expo-cli` or the equivalent yarn command.
6. **Inspect Build Logs:** Pay close attention to the error messages provided during the build process. These messages are often invaluable in identifying the specific issue.

Example of fixing a dependency conflict in `package.json`:

```json
// Incorrect (conflicting versions):
{"dependencies": {
  "expo": "^47.0.0",
  "react-native-vector-icons": "^9.2.0"
}}

// Corrected (compatible versions):
{"dependencies": {
  "expo": "^47.0.0",
  "react-native-vector-icons": "^9.2.0"
}}
```
By carefully following these steps, you should be able to resolve most uncommon Expo CLI build errors.
