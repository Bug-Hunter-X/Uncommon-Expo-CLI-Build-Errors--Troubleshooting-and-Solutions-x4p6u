# Uncommon Expo CLI Build Errors

This repository demonstrates a common yet elusive issue encountered when using the Expo CLI. The problem manifests as cryptic error messages during the build process, making debugging challenging.

This repo includes both the problematic code (`expoBug.js`) and its solution (`expoBugSolution.js`). The detailed explanation is provided within the code comments.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
4. Try to build the project using the Expo CLI. Observe the error messages in `expoBug.js` and the solution in `expoBugSolution.js`.

## Troubleshooting Tips:

* **Check Dependencies:** Ensure all your Expo dependencies are compatible with your Expo SDK version. Examine the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files for any conflicts.
* **Clean Cache:** Run `expo prebuild --clean` to clear any cached build artifacts.
* **Inspect `expo.json`:** Verify the correct configuration in the `expo.json` file.
* **Check Asset Handling:** Ensure that all assets are correctly configured and referenced in your project.
* **Review Logs:** Carefully examine the error messages generated during the build process to identify possible clues.
