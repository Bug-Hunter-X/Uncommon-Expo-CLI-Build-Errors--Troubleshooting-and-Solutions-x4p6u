This error typically arises when using the Expo CLI with a project that's improperly configured or has conflicting dependencies.  It often manifests as a cryptic error message during the build process, making it hard to pinpoint the exact cause.  A common scenario involves incompatible versions of Expo modules or native dependencies.  Sometimes, a corrupted `package.json` or `package-lock.json` file can also trigger this.  Another potential source is incorrect configuration within the `app.json` or `expo.json` file, particularly regarding asset handling or build settings.
